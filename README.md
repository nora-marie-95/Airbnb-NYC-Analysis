# Airbnb-NYC-Analysis

### Objective 
To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

### Data 
The main dataset is open-sourced from Kaggle and describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. The original data set has 48895 rows and 16 columns. [Link to data source](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

In addition, I used an open-sourced geojson file for my spatial analysis ([source](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2010-Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTAs-/cpf4-rkhq)), as well as time series data that provides infromation regarding listing prices in NYC, NY 2020 ([source](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)).

### Key Questions
1. How many lisitngs are there in each borough and where are they?
2. What is the most popular (least popular) borough? 
3. What is the price difference between neighbourhoods?
5. What are the most popular/least popular neighbourhoods? 
6. How do listing features inform the price of an Airbnb?
7. Can we predict prices?
